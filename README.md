# Perceptron_Algorithm
Perceptron Implementation with Iris Dataset

Created a class named Perceptron and created the needd methods for the implementation.

### fit Method
This method basically does the fitting/training process. It updates the weights based on the returned information from net_input() and predict() methods with **Delta Rule**.


### net_input Method
This method does the mathematical operation that ""multiplication of transpose of 'w' and X plus bias"" via dot product method from numpy (np.dot()).


### predict Method
This method is kind of activation function.
